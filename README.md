<h2>👋 Hello there! I’m Aliyyah </h2>

- 👀 I am currently a full time employee at a consulting company focusing on software and applications.
- 👩‍💻 My interests are data analytics/science, machine learning, front-end, and UI design.
- 🌱 Programming languages i've used (and still learning) are Javascript, Python, SQL, and I'm trying R!
- 💜 Outside of tech, I really enjoy listening to music, especially BTS (I'm a die hard Army!) and Seventeen. BTS & SVT is what keeps me motivated, and I aspire to be a hard worker just like them.
